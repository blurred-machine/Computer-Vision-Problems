# Computer-Vision-Problems
In this repository I have solved two problems of computer vision. First Implementation is building a CNN in which the input is a noisy number and the output is a denoised number. Second implementations is sequencing the characters read from number plates done using obect detection.

* Please use the jupyter notebook to run the above files in iPython environment.
* or directly run the `Problem_x.py` file in the python shell.

## Implementation

- Final Reult with accuracy of **81.27%** on Training and **81.35%** on Validation Set:

Thank You!
